# Website_Cuphead
A small project for a website about the game 'Cuphead'

This is a small project I did in school.
It’s about a game called Cuphead.
I wanted to experiment with different styles and techniques.
The website might not be the most beautiful, but it helped me improve a lot.
Inkwell Hell is the result of combining all the techniques I tried out.
It’s the final page I designed to see what I could achieve by applying everything I had learned.
In conclusion, this little project taught me a lot but there is still much to improve.
